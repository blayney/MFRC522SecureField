# MFRC522SecureField
A secure RFID system via MFRC522 and CE40HX1K-TQ144 FPGA.

The this repo is to track changes made to the hardware, and view issues for each version of the hardware independently.
This means that if a change is made to layout or to firmware / FPGA layout, and it causes a hardware issue, we can trace it back to the PR.
