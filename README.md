# MFRC522SecureField
A secure RFID system via MFRC522 and CE40HX1K-TQ144 FPGA.

The this repo is to track changes made to the hardware, and view issues for each version of the hardware independently.
This means that if a change is made to layout or to firmware / FPGA layout, and it causes a hardware issue, we can trace it back to the PR.

All layout and schema design is done in KiCad v5 and includes custom made libraries for new symbols and their footprints.
